# Building a TensorFlow CNN model for Image classification
This tutorial will walk you through building a TensorFlow model to classify images into one of 10 categories. The tutorial covers:

- Using the TensorFlow Datasets module to load the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Applying preprocessing steps to the data.
- Building a deep learning CNN model using the high level Keras API.
- Evaluating the model performance during and after training.

This notebook will not cover:

- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Early stopping.

### Notes:
- I am using Plotly to generate interactive graphs which are not rendered over GitHub. So, feel free to download the HTML file which has the code in the notebook with the graphs rendered.
- I will be adding more markdown cells to the notebook to explain the different arguments passed while creating the CNN model.
